# Cleaning and analyzing social media usage data with Python

This repository contains the code and documentation for a project on cleaning and analysing social media usage using python, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Jupyter Notebook and VsCode. 

## About

In this project, I'll serve as a data analyst at a specialized marketing firm focused on social media brand promotion. My primary task is to utilize Python to extract, clean, and analyze tweets within specific categories such as health, family, food, and more. By implementing the code provided, I'll generate insightful visualizations and conduct in-depth analysis to equip clients with actionable insights. My contributions will enable clients to optimize their social media presence, ensuring timely and budget-friendly tweet delivery. This project presents an opportunity for me to showcase my proficiency in Python, data analysis, and visualization techniques.
